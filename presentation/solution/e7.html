        // Exercise 7;
        // We're attempting to figure out when the user drags on the screen. 
        // We have done this in a way that is not really clean, next that it doesn't properly work.
        // Can you improve our code and fix the bug?
        //
        // *Bonus points* if you can manage the subscription as well to unsubscribe after one drag (click down then mouseup);
        // *More bonus points* if you can make the amount of times dragged before unsubscribe configurable. ;-)

        // Real error to fix here is: subscribe in subscribe

        // Solution: pipe with one subscribe / merge

        // Bonus: first take(1) switchMap

        const { Subject, zip } = rxjs;
        const { map } = rxjs.operators;

        // const moveSubject = new Subject();
        const downSubject = new Subject();
        const upSubject = new Subject();

        // Commented out; as we don't need it. But we could've used this as well!
        // window.addEventListener('mousemove', (ev) => {
        //     moveSubject.next(ev);
        // });

        window.addEventListener('mousedown', (ev) => {
            downSubject.next(ev);
        });

        window.addEventListener('mouseup', (ev) =>{
            upSubject.next(ev);
        })

        // const move$ = moveSubject.asObservable();
        const down$ = downSubject.asObservable();
        const up$ = upSubject.asObservable(); // could've also been `fromEvent(window, 'mouseup')`

        // basic solution
        zip(down$, up$).subscribe(val => {
            console.log(val);
        });
