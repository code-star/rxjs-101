## What is RxJS?

* A better way to manage data and events within your app. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Why RxJS?

* Better readable code ðŸ¤“<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Data flow ðŸŒŠ<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Easier and safer data transformations ðŸ¤–<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Functional and Reactive (!) ðŸ™Œ<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## What do you use RxJS for?

* Streaming data, (i.e. WebSocket) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Games <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Communicating between application components <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

#### Streaming data

```ts
const locationUpdates =
    webSocket('ws://some-live-shiplocation-api')

locationUpdates
    .subscribe(newShipLocation => {
        // update UI with new location i.e.
        this.state.shiplocation = newShipLocation
    })

```

----

#### Games

```ts
const ticks = interval(this.tickMs)
    .pipe(map() => 'tick'))
const frames = interval(this.fpsMs)
    .pipe(map() => 'frame'))
const seconds = interval(1000)
    .pipe(map() => 'second'))

this.update$ = merge(ticks, frames, seconds)
    .share()
```

----

#### Communicating between application components

Service
```ts
// Misschien geen Subjects laten zien in onze voorbeelden? Gaan we vragen over krijgen.
export class EventBusService {
    private events = new Subject<Event>();

    getEvents(): Observable<Event> {
        return this.events.asObservable();
    }

    sendEvent(event: Event): void {
        this.events.next(event);
    }
}
```

----

#### Communicating between application components

Component
```ts
export class Component {
    constructor(private eventsService: EventBusService) {
        this.eventsService.getEvents()
            .filter(event => event.type === 'InterestingEvent')
            .subscribe(this.handleEvents)
    }

    doAction(): void {
        this.eventsService.sendEvent(new TestEvent());
    }

    handleEvents(event: Event) { 
        //... do things 
    }
}
```

---

### So, RxJS?

* Used heavily by `Angular`
* Lot's of adoption in libraries like 
    * `Redux-observable`
    * `VueRx`
* Java/Scala also have their implementation.

#### ðŸ¤© So plenty of stuff to have fun with! ðŸ¤© <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Disclaimer

All examples are based on RxJS v6

```js
// RxJS v5
import * as Rx from 'rxjs'
const observable = Rx.Observable.from(...)

// RxJS v6
import { from } from 'rxjs'
const observable = from(...)
```

---

# The RxJS Contract

---

### Wait, what's a contract?

* A set of rules agreed upon <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Using the same language throughout <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Ensures we're all using the same things for the same reasons. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### So, the RxJS Contract

* Observable
* Operators
* Subscribers
* Subscription
* Subject

----

#### Observable

- Datasource* <!-- .element: class="small" -->
- You can `subscribe` to its contents, much like a newsletter.
- Unlike a newsletter, it won't send anything until at least someone has a `subscription`.
- You can use `operators` on it, to get the parts you are interested in.

----

#### Subscribers
```js
var obs = from([1, 2, 3]);

obs.subscribe(
    next => { console.log(next); },
    error => { },
    complete => { console.log('I\'m done!'); }
)

// What does this do?
```

* A subscriber activates an Observable. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Within a subscriber you handle every value, an error, or when it's done. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Without error handling, the subscription will end immediately <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

#### Subscription

```js
var obs = from([1, 2, 3]).delay(1);

var subscription = obs.subscribe(
    next => { console.log(next); },
    error => { },
    complete => { console.log('I\'m done!'); }
)

subscription.unsubscribe();

// What do you think this does?
```

```js
// and what happens when we remove the delay()?
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* A subscription let's you unsubscribe from the ~~newsletter~~ `Observable`.

----

#### Operators

* Operators are small operations you perform on top of your Observable. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* You can use multiple operators to transform the data to your liking. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* This is done using the pipe() method, introduced in RxJS 6.0.0. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```js
var obs = from([1, 2, 3])
    .pipe(
        map(x => x * 2),
        filter(x => x < 4)
    );
    
obs.subscribe(
    next => { console.log(next); }, // 2, 4
    error => { },
    complete => { console.log('I\'m done!'); }
)
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* There's multiple categories of operators. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

#### But wait, there's more! ðŸ™€

* Subject <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * BehaviorSubject
    * ReplaySubject
* Observers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

We may go into these later. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

â›” This is advanced, you can forget about these now. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Let's tango! ðŸ’ƒ

In your terminal: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/code-star/rxjs-101.git

---

# Exercises
Part one

----

### Exercise #1
Use `range()` to write your first Observable, and log its contents to your console.

Remember that an Observable does nothing on it's own!

```js
const { range } = rxjs;
const rangeObservable = range(1, 3);
// ...
```

---

# Operators

----

- We've talked about operators for a little bit.
- But there's more! 

----

* Transformation like `map()`
* Filtering lik `filter()`
* Utility like `tap()`
* Error handling like `catchError()`
* Combination like `merge()`
* Flattening like `switch()`
* Multicasting like `share()`
* And plenty of combined operators, like `switchMap()` or `mergeMap()`

----

### Todo: Add examples for all categories? Provide a simple list?

---

# Exercises
Part two

----

### Exercise #2
Use `filter()` to let the observable only return the numbers that are lower than 10

```js
const { from, pipe } = rxjs;
const { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;

const observable = from([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]).pipe(
    // apply filtering here... //
)

observable.subscribe(value => {
    console.log(value) // should log the values 1, 2, 4, 8
})
```

----

### Exercise #3
Use `map()` to multiply the values by 2

```js
const { from, pipe } = rxjs;
const { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;

const observable = from([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]).pipe(
    // apply transformations here... //
)

observable.subscribe(value => {
    console.log(value) // should log the values 2, 3, 8, 16, 32, 64
})
```

----

### Exercise #4
Combine `filter()`with `map()`.

Hint: use `typeof x === 'string'` and `toUpperCase()`

---

# Common mistakes
- By AndrÃ© Staltz

----

* Using Subjects too much. Use Observable.create!
* Using Observable.create too much. Use Creation operators
* Subscribing too much and unsubscribing too much
* Subject.next inside subscribe
* Subscribe inside subscribe

---

# Error handling
...

---

# Exercises
Part three

----

### Exercise #5
A: There are two things that are going wrong in this code. Can you see what they are? Adjust the code to fix those problems.

Hint: Run the example first and check the console log.

B: Rewrite this code so you don't need a Subject anymore.

Hint: the `from` creator and the `map` operator could help here.

----

### Exercise #6
A part of this exercise is given business logic, but we need the Observable to complete.

Add operators to make sure we handle any errors given by the Observable so it completes again.

---

# Cold versus Hot
Cold Observable
```js
new Observable((observer) => {
    // 'private' producer
    const producer = timer(5000)
    producer.subscribe(...)
})
```

Hot Observable
```js
// 'public' producer for reusability
const producer = timer(5000)
new Observable((observer) => {
  producer.subscribe(...)
})
```

---

# Exercises
Part four

----

### Exercise #7
Link the two observables to merge a PokÃ©mon Observable with a PokÃ©mon Moves Observable.

Hint; not all types have moves, and you only need (should have) 1 subscribe.

----

### Exercise #8
...tbd

---

## Suggestions:

* Refactor a piece of existing code to remove common mistakes
* Make a complex piece of code simpler by better using/combining operators
* ???

# Final review; 
- reflect on how easy it can be to read RxJS code
- Functional programming !!!
- RxJS and Reactive programming is a mindset. Get in the habit of doing it and it'll get easier.
